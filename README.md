# Cornered!

## Game Setup

1. Players start with 45 checkers each and a checkerboard.
2. Player 1 places a stack of 5 of their checkers on the third square in from one corner of the board.
3. Player 2 places a stack of 5 of their checkers on the third square in from the opposite corner.
4. Flip a coin to determine who goes first, then alternate turns until there is a winner.

## During Your Turn

1. Count the number of squares with at least 1 but fewer than 5 of your checkers. If there are fewer than the number of checkers you have outside the board, add 1 checker to the top of each of those squares.
2. Make up to 4 moves. Select a stack of at least 2 of your checkers and move to or attack an adjacent square...
   - If the adjacent square is empty, move all but one of your checkers into the empty square.
   - If the adjacent square has another stack of your checkers in it, move as many checkers as you can without exceeding 5 stacked checkers.
   - If the adjacent square has a stack of your opponent's checkers in it, carry out a battle (see below).

### Battle

1. Pair each attacking checker with a defending checker.
2. Generate a random number between 1 and the number of pairs.
3. Reduce your opponent's stack by this number.
4. Reduce your own stack by the number of paired defending checkers that are left, if any.
5. If your stack still has checkers but your opponent's does not, move all but 1 checker into the empty space.

## Winning The Game

The last player to maintain at least 1 of their checkers on their starting space wins.
