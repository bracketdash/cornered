# Cornered!

## Game Setup

1. Players start with 45 checkers each and a checkerboard.
2. Player 1 places a stack of 5 of their checkers on the third square in from one corner of the board.
3. Player 2 places a stack of 5 of their checkers on the third square in from the opposite corner.
4. Flip a coin to determine who goes first, then alternate turns until there is a winner.

## During Your Turn

1. Count the number of squares with at least 1 but fewer than 5 of your checkers. If there are fewer than the number of checkers you have outside the board, add 1 checker to the top of each of those squares.
2. Make up to 5 moves:

   - Move a checker of yours to an adjacent empty space or another of your stacks with fewer than 5 checkers
   - Attack an opponent's stack from an adjacent stack of yours: Flip a coin...
     - If heads, remove a checker from your opponentâ€™s stack.
     - If tails, remove a checker from your own stack.

## Winning The Game

The last player to maintain at least 1 of their checkers on their starting space wins.
